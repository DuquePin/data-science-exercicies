    "# Bank Marketing Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this simple project, we explore a dataset from a marketing campaign carried out through phone calls by a Portuguese banking institution and develop an application with **Streamlit**. The application accepts new data and presents it with customizable options.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will not create a model, but rather create a web application that can receive new data and show meaningful insights through graphs, with the option to download the processed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "The dataset used in this project was sourced from an external website, the original dataset is avaliable <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing\">here</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the project is a web application built with **Streamlit**, designed to run locally on your machine. The application is capable of accepting new datasets in either **CSV** or **Excel** format. It provides an intuitive interface for users to explore the data through various customizable graph options. Users can filter the data before generating graphs, ensuring that the visualizations are tailored to specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "The final product is a fully functional web application that allows users to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Upload new datasets in CSV or Excel format.\n",
    "- Filter the data to focus on specific subsets before generating visualizations.\n",
    "- Create and customize graphs based on the filtered data.\n",
    "- Download the processed data in CSV or Excel format for further use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This project was developed with the primary objective of studying and applying the technologies involved, particularly **Streamlit** for building interactive web applications and basic data processing techniques. While the application does not include machine learning models, it provides a valuable tool for exploring and visualizing data, offering insights through customizable graphs and data filtering options."
